# Trouble shooting 
Make sure that the Excel Doc is formated correctly. 
- Make sure that in the Days Column all entries are seperated with a dash and are the correct abreviation. 
- Make sure that the times are in the correct format of ##:## AM/PM    
-- Make sure none of the times are in military time. 
-- Make sure there are no trailing Zeros such as 12:00:00 PM
